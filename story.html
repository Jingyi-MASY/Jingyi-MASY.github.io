                    <p class="w3-large">Jingyi was in a sleeveless cyan dress at the southeast gate of campus. This is the first time Mingxuan asked Jingyi out. She arrived slightly earlier than the appointed time. The day before, Mingxuan took a new haircut. He thought of a few topics to arouse her interest. He checked activities and restaurants she may enjoy. But the moment he saw her face, he looked pretty clumsy. 4 hours later, she became his girlfriend. All the anxiety proved to be unnecessary. They are made for each other.</p>

                    <h2 class="w3-center">Meet the family</h2>
                    <p class="w3-large">It was an interesting experience to visit the city my partner grew up in. And it is definitely amusing to pretend “a good kid” before each other’s parents. All overnight activities and travel plans are strictly prohibited. We would kiss, hug and hold hands behind parents’ back. To take Jingyi around, Mingxuan stepped into some tourists’ attractions in Lanzhou for the first time in his 22 years of life. And storekeepers did not recognize he is a local, recommending mild in place of spicy food.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large">It has never been easy to start a new life in a different country, not to mention on the other end of the earth. We live in an area “12 hours away” from home. We have to work really hard to earn an opportunity. We are happy to have the one aside. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness, and in health, we would love, support and cherish each other.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large">We gradually become acquainted with Peter Pan drivers for travelling 3.5 hours between Providence and New York City on a weekly base. Mingxuan realized Brown University students can use their own student ID to gain access to Bobst Library. And Jingyi enjoys the tranquility of Providence River. She falls in love with Providence. And he falls in love with New York. Providence is always slightly chiller than NYC. But they are always in the same weather. Rain bands moves from southwest to northeast. And he sometimes wishes the rain can bring her to him. </p>
